# Laptop Sales Billing System

Laptop Sales Billing System is a C++ program designed to simulate a billing process for a laptop store. It calculates a detailed invoice for various laptop brands based on user inputs.

## Overview

This program allows the cashier to enter the quantities of laptops sold for different brandsâ€”Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, and Acer. It computes individual totals for each brand, sums them for a subtotal, applies an 8.25% tax rate, and then displays the final amount on a formatted invoice.

## Features
